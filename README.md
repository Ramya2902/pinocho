The sharing of large datasets from heterogeneous and interlinked data-sources with minimal risk would require informed consent from each party involved in the data requirement. This approach results in a very poor data sharing performance and currently, the existing system suffers from a lack of homogenization initiatives and requires individual negotiation process. Also the point that magnifies the need of a better infrastructure is the compliances with stringent security standards are not completely met for all data providers.
There is also a potential overall delay caused due to following reasons such as : committee review, resource allocation that goes into queue, query building, testing the query, and communication between different parties.
There is a need to design an architecture that enables an honest broker to automate the processes that affect the performance and take intelligent decisions on judging the trade off between security and performance. 

We utilized the existing open source Humhub portal and designed our honest broker system - Pinocho, to allow researcher to request for health dataset and therby simultaneously checking for compliance and the risk associated with the request.
This automation provides a faster data cooperation process for researchers and clinicians and also ensures both user and providerâ€™s are meeting their requirements.
