The sharing of large datasets from heterogeneous and interlinked data-sources with minimal risk would require informed consent from each party involved in the data requirement. This approach results in a very poor data sharing performance. The existing system suffers from a lack of homogenization initiatives and standard requires of individual negotiation process. Additionally, the compliances with stringent security standards are not completely met for all data providers.
There is also a potential delay caused due to committee review, resource allocation that goes into queue, query building, testing the query, and communication between different parties.
There is a need to design an architecture that enables an honest broker to automate the processes that affect the performance and take intelligent decisions when to compromise between security and performance. 

We utilized the existing open source humhub portal and designed our honest broker system - Pinocho, to allow researcher to request for health dataset and therby simultaneously checking for compliance and the risk associated with the request.
This automation provides a faster data negation process for researchers and clinicians and also ensures that both user and providerâ€™s side meet their requirements.
